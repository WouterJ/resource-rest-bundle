Feature: PHPCR resource repository
    In order to retrieve data from the resource webservice
    As a webservice user
    I need to be able to query the webservice

    Background:
        Given the test application has the following configuration:
            """
            cmf_resource:
                repositories:

    Scenario: Retrieve PHPCR resource with children

            | title | Article 1 |
            | body | This is my article |
        When I send a GET request to "/api/phpcr_repo/foo"
        Then the response should contain json:
            """
            {

            """
            {"node_name": "foo-bar"}

        Then the response code should be 200
